# Support the Deterministic Mission 🛡️🌿

The development of **Intent-Garden**, **Garden-Core**, and the **Rule-ROM** standard is a self-funded, independent R&D initiative based in Tomsk, Siberia. We do not accept VC pressure; we accept the **Intent** of the global engineering community.

Your support directly funds:
1. **The Silicon Bridge**: Transitioning the **Decima8** core from emulation to native FPGA hardware.
2. **The Registry**: Hosting and maintaining the open **Rule-ROM** Wiki for the world.
3. **The Lab**: Upgrading our R&D station (Mac Mini M3 Pro / ARM / Dual 4K telemetry).
