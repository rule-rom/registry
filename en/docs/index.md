# Rule-ROM: Global Registry of Executable Intentions 📜🛡️

**We translate AI from the realm of probabilities to the realm of executable Intent.**

The Rule-ROM project is a deterministic barrier that transforms the stochastic noise of neural networks into verifiable results.

## 🏛️ About the Federation

This is an expandable federation of technical standards. We create a universal control bus — from C source code to neuromorphic silicon and industrial automation. Any technology where "best practices" and safety rules can be formalized can be integrated into the Registry.
