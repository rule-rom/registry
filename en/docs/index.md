# Rule-ROM: Sovereign Standard of Determinism 📜🛡️

## Manifesto of Determinism

> *"In a world of non-deterministic code, we build islands of predictability"*

## 🛠️ Three Pillars of the System

### 1. Code Validation (Garden-Core)

We don't rely on "prompts" or AI intuition. We use formal logic to control the C stack.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Mechanics** | Clang AST matching with Lisp-intents (EDN) |
| **Principle** | Any code without explicit Intent is considered noise and pruned |
| **Result** | Code QA, deterministic onboarding of new engineers and AI agents |

### 2. Neuromorphic Core (Decima8)

Rule-ROM logic is transferred from software to physical substrate.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Essence** | Neuromorphic architecture where "personalities" (like our OCR-Typographer) are baked deterministically |
| **Goal** | Direct intent execution in silicon (ASIC) without overhead of classical OS |
| **Status** | Working emulator, preparation for first silicon production, personalities lab launched |

### 3. Sovereign Environment (Nomos)

Determinism is impossible in a "cloud" that doesn't belong to you.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Maintenance** | Lifetime standard support and versioning |
| **Autonomy** | Full self-hosting of infrastructure (S3, Git, Swarm nodes) on own hardware and all major providers worldwide |
| **Sovereignty** | Your intellectual property is physically protected in the "Headquarters" |

## 🏛️ Rule-ROM Constitution

### 1. Intent is Primary Over Code

Code without explicit reflection in the **Intents Registry** is considered noise. The executable system has the right to ignore or prune any instructions whose origin is not deterministic.

### 2. Vacuum Isolation (The Sandbox)

Any interaction of an AI agent with a critical system occurs through an **"intentional gateway"**. The agent doesn't "write a program", it materializes a specification strictly bounded by Garden-Core.

### 3. Substrate Sovereignty

Determinism is inseparable from the physical medium. Rule-ROM rules must execute identically in the emulator, in C code, and in Decima8 neuromorphic silicon.

### 4. Hierarchy of Responsibility

The right to modify global Intents and access to low-level bus protocols is distributed according to contribution to Swarm development. **16 Elders** maintain architectural balance, **256 Nodes** ensure network coverage.
