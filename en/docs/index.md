# Manifesto of Determinism

> *"In a world of non-deterministic code, we build islands of predictability"*

## Principles

- **Determinism Above All**: Code must behave identically given the same inputs.
- **Explicitness Over Implicitness**: All assumptions must be expressed explicitly in types and contracts.
- **Verifiability**: Every function must be verifiable against its specification.

## Rule-ROM Constitution

This document describes the fundamental principles upon which the entire Intent-Garden ecosystem is built.

### 1. Memory is a Resource

Memory allocation must be explicit, controlled, and traceable.

### 2. Bounds are a Contract

Every array out-of-bounds access is a contract violation that must be detected at compile-time or runtime.

### 3. Types are Intentions

The type system must express developer intentions, not just restrict capabilities.
