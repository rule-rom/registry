# Rule-ROM: Federation of Deterministic Standards 📜🛡️

**The central hub of the Intent-Garden ecosystem.**

We divide management of code, hardware, and meaning into four independent domains. Choose your entry point based on your engineering task:

## 🔗 Entry Points

### 🌿 [C-SAFE](https://c-safe.rulerom.com) — Legacy Immunization

Specifications and intents for safe C. Validation via Clang AST and Garden-Core. Here we transform stochastic AI-agent code into deterministic instructions.

### 🧠 [Decima](https://decima.rulerom.com) — Neuromorphic Substrate

Low-level protocols of Decima8 core. PHASE_READ/WRITE bus description, tile logic, and "latch corridor" physics. For those who build hardware.

### 🧪 [Bakery](https://bakery.rulerom.com) — Personality Bakery

Methodology for training and "baking" neuromorphic skills. Pattern library for vision (OCR), audio (ASR), and market strategies (HFT).

### 🔈 [Audrey](https://audrey.rulerom.com) — Analog Soul

Standards of physical frequencies. Tube technology on G-807, output transformer calculations, and the connection between vacuum sound and digital determinism.
