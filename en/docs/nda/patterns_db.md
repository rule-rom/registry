# 🔒 Access Restricted: Tier 3+ (Industrial)

## Decima8 Patterns Database

This page contains the library of ready-made activation patterns for Decima8 neuromorphic core.

### What's Inside

- **Patterns DB** — Library of ready-made patterns (EDN + binary TLV)
- **Activation Graphs** — Activation graphs for typical tasks
- **Decay Profiles** — Decay profiles for various scenarios
- **Fuse Configurations** — Range-based fuse configurations

### Pattern Formats

| Format | Description | Tier |
|--------|-------------|------|
| `.d8p` | Binary pattern (Bake Blob) | 3+ |
| `.d8e` | EDN pattern source | 4+ |
| `.d8lib` | Pattern library | 4+ |
| `.d8meta` | Metadata + validation | 5+ |
